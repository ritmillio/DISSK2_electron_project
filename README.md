# DISSK2_electron_project - 

if you do not know what is electron : https://www.electronjs.org/

The project is simple, there is a table with simple functions such as adding or deleting rows or columns.
This project developed for a study program on UCN therefor the project could not contain any particular data so feel free to add your own data by editing some code inside index.html and script.js
